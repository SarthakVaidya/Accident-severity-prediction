Abstract
This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments for Masters research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms. RTA Dataset.csv is the dataset before preprocessing and cleaned.csv is the preprocessed dataset.

# Machine Learning 

Step 1 : EDA
Step 2 : Preprocessing
Step 3 : Upsampling
Step 4 : Passing train/test data to select best performing algorithm
Step 5 : Hyperparameter Tuning 
Step 6 : Load model into a .pkl/.joblib file


#Deployment 
Step 1 : create app.py for front-end
Step 2 : load model using gdrive(for large file size)
Step 3 : load necessary files into github like Procfile, setup.sh, requirements.txt, runtime.txt
Step 4 : Create heroku profile, connect your github repository and deploy.
